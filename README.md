# Heart-Disease-Prediction
A model trained on data from kaggle that predicts existing heart disease considering parameters like gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, age etc. 

Using different types of Machine Learning models, it includes different accuracy scores and a comparison of all models like linear regression, decision tree, XGBoost, Neural Network etc.

This repository contains a machine learning model trained on a dataset from Kaggle to predict the presence of heart disease based on various patient parameters. The model leverages different types of ML models to analyze data points such as gender, age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other relevant factors.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: The project includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering techniques to prepare the data for modeling.
Model Training: The model is trained on a labeled dataset, learning patterns and correlations between the input features and the target variable (presence or absence of heart disease).
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Deployment: The trained model can be deployed in a suitable environment for real-time predictions.
Potential Use Cases:

Healthcare Institutions: The model can assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at risk of heart disease, enabling early intervention and preventive measures.
Research: The model can contribute to research on heart disease risk factors and the effectiveness of different treatments.
Personal Health: Individuals can use the model to assess their own risk of heart disease and make informed lifestyle choices.
